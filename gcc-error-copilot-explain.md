Workspace: The provided log file appears to be a validation report for a CSV file. The report starts by specifying the format and structure of the CSV file, including details such as the delimiter used (CSVDelimited), whether the file contains a header row (ColNameHeader=True), and the decimal symbol (DecimalSymbol=.).

Each column in the CSV file is defined with a name, data type, and width. For example, `Col1` is named `part_number`, has a data type of `Text`, and a width of 15 characters. Some columns also have enumerations defined, which restrict the values that can be entered in those columns. For instance, `Col15=gcc_code` has an enumeration that includes values like `AUTO`, `ACCESSORIES`, and `01125ADSACCACC`.

The log then lists several errors encountered during the validation process. Most of these errors are related to `Column 15`, where the value "AUTO|ACCESSORIES|ACCESSORIES|01125ADSACCACC" is repeatedly flagged as not being a valid enumeration member. Additionally, there are errors related to the length of values in `Column 31` and `Column 23`, indicating that the data exceeds the specified width for these columns.

The log also mentions some general settings and reformatting actions, such as changing the column separator from a comma to a semicolon, and trimming all values. Despite these adjustments, the validation process still found numerous data errors, indicating issues with the data that need to be addressed to meet the specified format and constraints.

damian-dev1: how to fix error:
** error line 9: Column 15 value "AUTO|ACCESSORIES|ACCESSORIES|01125ADSACCACC" is not a valid enumeration member
?

GitHub Copilot: To fix the error on line 9 where `Column 15` value "AUTO|ACCESSORIES|ACCESSORIES|01125ADSACCACC" is not a valid enumeration member, you need to ensure that the value in `Column 15` matches one of the valid enumeration members defined for that column. 

Here are the steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Check the Enumeration Definition**: Verify the valid enumeration values for `Column 15`. This can be found in the commented section of the configuration or schema file. For example:
   ```log
   ;Col15=gcc_code Enumeration AUTO|ACCESSORIES|ACCESSORIES|01125ADSACCACC
   ```

2. **Correct the Value**: Ensure that the value in `Column 15` for line 9 matches one of the valid enumeration values. If "AUTO|ACCESSORIES|ACCESSORIES|01125ADSACCACC" is not a valid value, replace it with a valid one.

3. **Update the CSV File**: Edit the CSV file to correct the value in `Column 15` for the specified line. For example, if the valid value is "AUTO", update the CSV file accordingly.

Example:
```csv
part_number,bigbuys_sports_size,comp_stem_suitableforages,link_youtube,image,image_2,image_3,image_4,image_5,image_6,image_7,image_8,image_9,image_10,gcc_code,sap_article_ID,barcode,model,def_general_brand,other_brand,short_description,second_line_short_description,description,def_general_maincolour,def_warranty_manufacture,warranty_type,country_of_manufacture,def_dimension_prodheight,def_dimension_prodwidth,def_dimension_proddepth,def_general_packcontents,def_dimension_packheight,def_dimension_packwidth,def_dimension_packdepth,package_gross_weight,supplier_comments
12345,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AUTO,12345678,1234567890123,ModelX,BrandY,OtherBrand,Short description,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
```

4. **Revalidate the CSV File**: After making the corrections, re-run the validation process to ensure that the error is resolved.

By following these steps, you should be able to fix the enumeration error for `Column 15` on line 9.

damian-dev1: it should be just a string, enumeration member.

GitHub Copilot: To fix the error where the value in `Column 15` should be just a string instead of an enumeration member, you need to update the configuration to treat `Column 15` as a text field without enumeration constraints.

Here are the steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Update the Configuration**: Modify the configuration to ensure `Column 15` is treated as a text field without enumeration constraints. Remove or comment out the enumeration definition for `Column 15`.

2. **Edit the CSV File**: Ensure that the values in `Column 15` are treated as plain text strings.

Example configuration change:
```log


Col15=gcc_code Text Width 43
;Col15=gcc_code Enumeration AUTO|ACCESSORIES|ACCESSORIES|01125ADSACCACC
```

By commenting out the enumeration line, `Column 15` will be treated as a text field.

3. **Revalidate the CSV File**: After making the configuration changes, re-run the validation process to ensure that the error is resolved.

This should fix the issue by treating the value in `Column 15` as a plain string rather than an enumeration member.
